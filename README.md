User Stories:

☛ I am presented with a random series of button presses.

☛ Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.

☛ If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.

☛ I can win the game by getting a series of 3 steps correct . I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.

Rules:
