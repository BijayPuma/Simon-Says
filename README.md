# Simon-Game-Bijay

User Stories: I am presented with a random series of button presses.
User Stories: Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.
User Stories: If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.
User Stories: I can win the game by getting a series of 10 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.
